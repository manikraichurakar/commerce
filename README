This is an quick example of multi-db support in django and a
demonstration of the inspectdb management command as requested by
students in my Django class. 

The sample database comes from http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/ -
see the license for the included .sqlite database there.

The chinook app is the result of running the inspectdb command to
generate a models file and writng a router to handle my desired use
case where:

 - models from the required contrib apps live in their own .sqlite db
 - but we create an admin to edit the (otherwise unmodified) chinook
   database.
